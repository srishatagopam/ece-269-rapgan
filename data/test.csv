10555,Kendrick Lamar,Kendrick Lamar: Rapper of the Year - GQ,"Much of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos—some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton—and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. ""When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets—nobody never really knows,"" he says. ""But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman."""

Pharrell said, “Never feel that way again. When that little negative man come behind your head, always follow your first heart, and that was your first heart, to put the album out like this.” This is his words verbatim, he said, “Watch what’s gonna happen.”I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten.When I come up to certain artists, artists that I’ve always looked up to, and they can recite my records that wasn’t the single, that puts me in a space where, okay, this is a person I always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me.

He only made it ""back to the set"" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. ""It can be complicated and confusing,"" Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. ""From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous—I still live in this world."" And when someone back home needs something, ""I still gotta get that phone call."""
